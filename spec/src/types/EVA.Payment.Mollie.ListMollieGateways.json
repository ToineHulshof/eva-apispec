  "description": "When you would like to control payment type and issuer selection yourself, you can use \u0060ListMollieGateways\u0060 to retrieve a list of supported payment types (\u0022gateways\u0022) from Mollie. Currently they\nsupport iDEAL, Bitcoin, bank transfer, credit card and a couple more, all configurable through Mollie. This response will include icons and descriptions in the supplied locale, and in case of iDEAL\nwill include a list of \u0022issuers\u0022 like ING, Rabobank, etcetera.\n\nThen when creating a payment, include a \u0060GatewayID\u0060 and this payment type is automatically chosen. Additionally include \u0060Issuer\u0060 and this too is automatically selected.\n\nConfigure \u0060Mollie:Api:BaseUrl\u0060 (although it doesn\u0027t seem you want to deviate from the default) and specify a \u0060Mollie:Api:Token\u0060.\n\nEVA will require the selected payment type configured in the \u0022MOLLIE_\u0060GatewayID\u0060\u0022 format, for instance \u0022MOLLIE_BITCOIN\u0022 and \u0022MOLLIE_IDEAL\u0022, and the \u0022MOLLIE\u0022 payment type is no longer required.",
