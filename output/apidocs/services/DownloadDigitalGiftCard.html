<h1>DownloadDigitalGiftCard</h1><p>Download the GiftCard data for a specific order, based on given `OrderID` and `GiftCardID`. This order needs to be visible for the current user. Requires
the order to be shipped (automatically when it is fully paid).

Additionally, this service can be called with an `AccessToken` and `GiftCardID` combination. In this case, no user validation is done - you know both
keys to the GiftCard, so you are allowed to get it&#39;s information.

If you want, you can specify a `LanguageID` to use for rendering the report - when omitted, the `LanguageID` of the current user.

See `GetDigitalGiftCardsForOrder` service for more details.</p>
