<h1>ListEventLedger</h1><p>This service lets you query the EventLedger for auditing purposes.

The request provides a PageConfig (of type ScrollablePageConfig) that lets you filter on the given properties in the EventLedger.
Paging is done by providing the request with the `NextResultToken` that you got back from the previous request.
As this method of paging is forward-only, you can&#39;t go back to a previous page unless you store the token or the results,
and the total number of results is unknown, only whether or not there are more results (determined by if the NextResultToken is null).

The response contains the whole EventLedger document.

Possible filters:

- Types: A list of strings that refer to the `Type` field that is in every document.
- OrderID: Only return documents that contain a reference to the given OrderID
- OrganizationUnitID: Only return documents that were created by someone logged into the given OrganizationUnitID. It&#39;s recommended that this filter is always used, due to performance reasons.
- DeviceID: Filters on documents that have a reference to the given device, usually associated with a payment or a print command.
- FromDate: Only return documents newer than this date. It&#39;s recommended that this filter is always used, due to performance reasons.
- ToDate: Only return documents older than this date. It&#39;s recommended that this filter is always used, due to performance reasons.
- UserIDs: Only return documents created by these users. The IDs for this can be gotten by first doing a user search.
- FirstName: Filter on documents created by users whose first name starts with this. Achieves the same as filtering on UserIDs, but with one step less. However, due to privacy reasons, this information isn&#39;t stored for customers.
