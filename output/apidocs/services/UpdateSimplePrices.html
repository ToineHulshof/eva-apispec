<h1>UpdateSimplePrices</h1><p>Update the prices in the pricelist specified.

This service takes a simplified approach of the pricing tools EVA offers, but that limits the options you have available. The PriceList to update may
only have a single active PriceListAdjustment, and that has to be of type MANUAL_INPUT.

* The pricelist is identified by the `PriceListID` or the `BackendSystemID` and `BackendID`.
* Products can be identified by their (EVA) `ID` or their `BackendID`</p>
