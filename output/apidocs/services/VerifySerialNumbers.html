<h1>VerifySerialNumbers</h1><p>Verify the serial numbers on given order lines, lifting the `SerialNumberValidationRequired` hold status. Specified lines without hold status are
silently skipped and ignored.

Optionally specify the `SerialNumber` that was validated to match, preventing possible race conditions. Invalid matches will return a 400 BAD REQUEST
and not make any change to lines that may have been valid.</p>
