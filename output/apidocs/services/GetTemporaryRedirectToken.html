<h1>GetTemporaryRedirectToken</h1><p>Create a temporary token, based off of your current authentication token, which can be passed in query parameters for redirect requests. On the
receiving side, post this token in the `Login` service request body as `AuthenticationToken` to retrieve a new token, similar to the original
token, preserving user and context.

Note this token lifetime is only 30 seconds, and has no rights to do anything else.</p>
