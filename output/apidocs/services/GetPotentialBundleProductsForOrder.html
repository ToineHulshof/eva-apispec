<h1>GetPotentialBundleProductsForOrder</h1><p>This service returns the bundles for which you currently have at least one product in the provided order.
This can then be used to suggest bundles to the end-user that they&#39;re missing out on.

The IncludedFields field controls which product content you get back for each bundle product. By default, only the product&#39;s display value is returned.

Specifying the ProductIDs field means that only suggestions for the given products are returned.
If the Order does not contain the provided ProductIDs, nothing will be returned.</p>
