  "description": "This service lets you create and update a set of products and their content.\n\nThe set is products is hierarchical in nature. For example, if you have a shirt that comes in 3 colors and 5 sizes per color, you would normally define a root product that then contains the 3 color products\nand each color product would contain the 5 different sizes, which would be the SKU. How you define the hierarchy is up to you, it\u0027s also fine to have the 3 color products as root products and only have them\ncontain the SKUs, or to forego a hierarchy entirely and just create the SKUs, but creating the root and color products is useful for search and frontend purposes.\n\n\nAn example request of a hierarchy:\n\n{\n  \u0022ID\u0022: \u0022special_shirt\u0022,\n  \u0022Name\u0022: \u0022Special Shirt\u0022,\n  \u0022TaxCode\u0022: \u0022High\u0022,\n  \u0022Variations\u0022: {\n    \u0022Property\u0022: \u0022color_code\u0022,\n    \u0022LogicalLevel\u0022: \u0022color\u0022,\n    \u0022Products\u0022: [\n      {\n        \u0022ID\u0022: \u0022special_shirt_blue\u0022,\n        \u0022Name\u0022: \u0022Special Shirt - Blue\u0022,\n        \u0022VariationValues\u0022: [\n          {\n            \u0022LanguageID\u0022: null,\n            \u0022Value\u0022: \u0022BLUE\u0022\n          }\n        ],\n        \u0022Variations\u0022: {\n          \u0022Property\u0022: \u0022size_code\u0022,\n          \u0022LogicalLevel\u0022: \u0022size\u0022,\n          \u0022Products\u0022: [\n            {\n              \u0022ID\u0022: \u0022sku_special_shirt_blue_xl\u0022,\n              \u0022VariationValues\u0022: [\n                {\n                  \u0022LanguageID\u0022: null,\n                  \u0022Value\u0022: \u0022XL\u0022\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}"
