<h1>GetProductForQuickEditByID</h1><p>Retrieves a `Product` with detailed information, based on all currently applied `Revision`&#39;s and the `Layer` data compressed into a single truth, from the given `ID` parameter.

In the response, `Content` is a Json formatted object containing key-value pair data, where the keys are simple strings and the value can be a scalar value (like an int or string), an array of scalar
values or an array of objects.

The `Types` property in the response data holds meta-data information about the property keys used in the `Content` object like property name, group and (of course) data type.

:point_right: Use the `GetProductForEditByID` service when you want to specify the `Revision` to apply and receive per-layer `Content`.</p>
