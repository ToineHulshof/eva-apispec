<h1>SubscribeToFeed</h1><p>Subscribe to the specified feed for the current User&#39;s `ApplicationID`.

`Name` is the name of the file you wish to watch. The `WebhookUrl` is called with a JSON POST request, in which the Feed&#39;s `name` and `applicationID` are specified. This request does not contain the data
itself, your application will have to fetch the data using your current approaches to download this feed. This may seem verbose, but we have no guarantee the endpoint is secure, and we can&#39;t just send
possibly sensitive information there!

To unsubscribe, call the `UnsubscribeFromFeed` service with the returned `ID` value.</p>
