<h1>UploadStockAllocationRulesExcel</h1><p>A service to upload an Excel containing StockAllocationRules that should be created or updated according to the values specified in the sheet.

An example Excel file containing the expected structure can be retrieved by calling the `DownloadStockAllocationRulesExcel` service. Important to note however
is that the first column (&#39;C/U/D&#39; which stands for Create/Update/Delete) will be empty in the Excel file returned by `DownloadStockAllocationRulesExcel`, but to update
or create a record the first column must have a value according to what you want to do with it. To create a row, the first column must contain &#39;C&#39;, to update it must contain &#39;U&#39; (and the ID column must have a value pointing to the correct record)
and to delete it it must contain &#39;D&#39;.</p>
