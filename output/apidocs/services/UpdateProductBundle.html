<h1>UpdateProductBundle</h1><p>This service is largely the same as CreateProductBundle.
The model passed into the request body is considered to be the entire bundle configuration.
Any lines that are currently present but not present in the update model are removed from the bundle.
The only parameter that is different is that the model requires an ID to be set for the root object and its lines, which you get back from the `GetProductBundle` and `ListProductBundles` services.</p>
