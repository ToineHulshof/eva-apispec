<h1>ListMollieGateways</h1><p>When you would like to control payment type and issuer selection yourself, you can use `ListMollieGateways` to retrieve a list of supported payment types (&quot;gateways&quot;) from Mollie. Currently they
support iDEAL, Bitcoin, bank transfer, credit card and a couple more, all configurable through Mollie. This response will include icons and descriptions in the supplied locale, and in case of iDEAL
will include a list of &quot;issuers&quot; like ING, Rabobank, etcetera.

Then when creating a payment, include a `GatewayID` and this payment type is automatically chosen. Additionally include `Issuer` and this too is automatically selected.

Configure `Mollie:Api:BaseUrl` (although it doesn&#39;t seem you want to deviate from the default) and specify a `Mollie:Api:Token`.

EVA will require the selected payment type configured in the &quot;MOLLIE_`GatewayID`&quot; format, for instance &quot;MOLLIE_BITCOIN&quot; and &quot;MOLLIE_IDEAL&quot;, and the &quot;MOLLIE&quot; payment type is no longer required.</p>
