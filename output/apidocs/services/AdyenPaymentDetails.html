<h1>AdyenPaymentDetails</h1><p>Submits details for an Adyen payment created using `CreatePayment`. This step is only needed when no final state has been reached on the
`CreatePayment` request (for example for 3D Secure, or when getting redirected back directly from a payment method using an app switch).

The exact details, which need to be sent to this endpoint, are always specified in the `Properties.Data` parameter in the response of the
associated `CreatePayment` request.</p>
