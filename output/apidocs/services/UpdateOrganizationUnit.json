This service can be used to only update a subset of the settings of the OrganizationUnit by providing only the fields you want to update.\n\nIf a field is not part of the request message (or has value \u0060undefined\u0060) then the setting is not updated. If the field is present but has a value of \u0060null\u0060 then it\u0027s assumed you want to unset the setting."
