<h1>DeleteUserPhoneNumber</h1><p>Delete a user&#39;s phone number based on the provided ID. If you&#39;re trying to delete a user&#39;s primary phone number and that user has
more than two phone numbers currently, this service will return a `CannotDeletePrimaryPhoneNumber` error,
because it cannot determine what number should now become the user&#39;s primary phone number. If the user has two numbers, the other number
will become the primary.

This service only allows the number&#39;s own user or an employee to delete it.</p>
