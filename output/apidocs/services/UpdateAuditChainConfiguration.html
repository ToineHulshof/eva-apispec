<h1>UpdateAuditChainConfiguration</h1><p>Updates an existing AuditChainConfiguration, which allows you to configure the starting number of a sequence and its prefix.
Updating a configuration for an audit chain that already exists does not apply this updated configuration. A new chain would need to be created by incrementing the Auditing:Version setting.</p>
