<h1>DuplicateOrder</h1><p>Make a new `Order` based on an existing one.

* Optionally you can provide some OrderLineIDs to duplicate only a subset of the order.
* When an `OrganizationUnitID` is set, the Order will be created Originating and SoldFrom the specified OrganizationUnit
* To include the orignal GiftWrapping the flag `IncludeGiftWrapping` should be set to true. When combining this with a subset of lines, this can generate an error when some wrapped lines are not duplicated.
* To ignore shipping costs, set `IgnoreShippingCosts` to true (defaults to false)</p>
