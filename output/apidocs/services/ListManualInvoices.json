  "description": "List manually created invoices. These invoices are created via the \u0060CreateManualInvoice\u0060 service and are used as a worst-case scenario when everything has gone offline and the retailer has to make invoices on actual paper. These services are then used to enter the paper invoices back in to EVA."
