Once a successful\nscan event was triggered, this original \u0060RequestToken\u0060 is then \u0027confirmed\u0027 and you can use it directly as elevation header for your original call. Keep it safe!\n\n:bulb: Optionally supply the \u0060OrganizationUnitID\u0060, \u0060Functionality\u0060 and \u0060Scope\u0060 of your original request, so we can check the manager rights directly from the scan\non his/her device. Omitting these here will fall back to the default security enforced from the user attempting to use the (confirmed) elevation token, which just gives\na nasty 403 on the employee\u0027s device.",
