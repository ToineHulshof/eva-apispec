<h1>GetDigitalGiftCardsForOrder</h1><p>Retrieve the GiftCard data for a specific order, based on given `OrderID`. This order needs to be visible for the current user.

Will return a list of `GiftCard` data, for every orderline with a GiftCard. Will return the same data supplied in the `AddGiftCardToOrder`
service. When the order was shipped (automatically when it is fully paid), the details `GiftCardNumber` and
`Pin` are also included. An additional property `IsAvailable` let&#39;s you check if it was indeed shipped and paid.

The `GiftCardID` returned on the GiftCard is it&#39;s unique identifier, to be used in conjunction with the `AccessToken` to make it globally
unique. Using the `AccessToken` and `GiftCardID`, we are pretty sure you are allowed to see the GiftCard data. Use this data to build the link
to share directly, or use the approperiate services to mail/text/print this.

Additionally, this service can be called with an `AccessToken` and `GiftCardID` combination, as explained above. In this case, no user validation
is done - you know both keys to the GiftCard, so you are allowed to get it&#39;s information.</p>
