<h1>UpdateProductCapacityPlan</h1><p>Update a product capacity plan.
When the product capacity plan is changed from static to dynamic, and this is as requested, the service requires the `AllowStaticToDynamicTypeChange` to be set to true.
If `AllowStaticToDynamicTypeChange` is false, the service will return an error when the product capacity plan switches from static to dynamic.</p>
