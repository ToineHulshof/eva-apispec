<h1>ImportProducts</h1><p>This service lets you create and update a set of products and their content.

The set is products is hierarchical in nature. For example, if you have a shirt that comes in 3 colors and 5 sizes per color, you would normally define a root product that then contains the 3 color products
and each color product would contain the 5 different sizes, which would be the SKU. How you define the hierarchy is up to you, it&#39;s also fine to have the 3 color products as root products and only have them
contain the SKUs, or to forego a hierarchy entirely and just create the SKUs, but creating the root and color products is useful for search and frontend purposes.


An example request of a hierarchy:

{
  &quot;ID&quot;: &quot;special_shirt&quot;,
  &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Special Shirt&quot;,
  &quot;TaxCode&quot;: &quot;High&quot;,
  &quot;Variations&quot;: {
    &quot;Property&quot;: &quot;color_code&quot;,
    &quot;LogicalLevel&quot;: &quot;color&quot;,
    &quot;Products&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;ID&quot;: &quot;special_shirt_blue&quot;,
        &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Special Shirt - Blue&quot;,
        &quot;VariationValues&quot;: [
          {
            &quot;LanguageID&quot;: null,
            &quot;Value&quot;: &quot;BLUE&quot;
          }
        ],
        &quot;Variations&quot;: {
          &quot;Property&quot;: &quot;size_code&quot;,
          &quot;LogicalLevel&quot;: &quot;size&quot;,
          &quot;Products&quot;: [
            {
              &quot;ID&quot;: &quot;sku_special_shirt_blue_xl&quot;,
              &quot;VariationValues&quot;: [
                {
                  &quot;LanguageID&quot;: null,
                  &quot;Value&quot;: &quot;XL&quot;
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
