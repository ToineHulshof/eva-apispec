<h1>SearchOrders</h1><p>Search for any type of orders by providing the filter details properties
Important search criterias are: OrganizationUnitID, CurrentOrganizationUnitType, OrderID, CustomerID(ClientContext.Type), IsPaid.
OrderID and IsPaid are going to be replaced by OrderIDs (and array of IDs) and PaymentStatus (an enum).

To include the custom fields of the customer, the property `AdditionalOrderDataOptions.CustomerCustomFields` can be set to `true`.

E.g. request:
{
  &quot;OrderIDs&quot;: [
    &quot;orderID1&quot;,
    &quot;orderID2&quot;
  ],
  &quot;PaymentStatus&quot;: &quot;PaymentStatus&quot;,
  &quot;IsShipped&quot;: &quot;isShipped&quot;
}


Payment status options:
    NotPaid = 0,
    Paid = 1,
    Partial = 2</p>
