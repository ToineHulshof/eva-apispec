<h1>CreateCustomerReturn</h1><p>Create a return order from an existing sales order (`OrderID`).

When a `TargetOrderID` has been specified, newly created lines are added to that specific order. When omitted, the lines are either added to the
existing, original order (in case that is still permitted) or a new order is created automatically.

Returns information on the (newly created?) return order.</p>
