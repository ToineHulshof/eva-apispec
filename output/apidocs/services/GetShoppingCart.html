<h1>GetShoppingCart</h1><p>This returns the requested order. The order is retreived based on the OrderID.

The order will be recalculated:
- Discounts
- ShippingCosts
- GiftWrappingCosts
- OrderLine prices

If no recalculation is needed, use the GetOrder service instead. In general the approach would be: use GetShoppingCart while building the order, after PrepareOrderForCheckout has been called, switch to GetOrder.
