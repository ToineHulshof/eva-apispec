<h1>StartOpenCashJournal</h1><p>Starts the opening of a cash journal for the given DeviceID.

It&#39;s only possible to open a cash journal when an open financial period exists and when the device is a cash device. Retrieving a list of valid devices
can be accomplished through the `ListDevices` service.

Calling this service does not yet do anything, except return the data you need to open a cash journal:

- The available denominations (coins and notes)
- The details about the previous cash journal&#39;s closing amounts (if it exists), which can be used as an extra check
- Possible pending cash deposits on this device</p>
