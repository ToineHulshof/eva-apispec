<h1>CreateCashExpense</h1><p>Creates a cash expense.

This service expects:
- `DeviceID`, which is the cash device the money was used from.
- `TypeID` which is one of the available expense types.
- An `Amount`, which is the amount of cash that was taken from or added to the device.
The amount should always be positive, but the semantics of the amount depends on the AmountType of the ExpenseType:
if ExpenseType.AmountType = Expense, then the amount is booked as an expense, if it&#39;s Income then it&#39;s booked as income. Either way, it should be a positive number.
- A `TaxCodeID`, which refers to one of the available tax codes.
- A `Description`, which is the reason for this expense (for example: &#39;lunch&#39;).
- A `BlobID`, which contains an image of the receipt.
- A `SignatureBlobID`, which contains an image of the signature</p>
