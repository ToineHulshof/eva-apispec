<h1>CreateBlob</h1><p>Creates a new, empty blob. If you wish to store data in there directly, use the `StoreBlob` service instead.

Empty blobs are placeholders; eventually, you&#39;ll want to push data in there. This service allows you to create that placeholder, and it is expected you then use the
multipart or raw binary `POST` call to `/blob/{Guid}` to push your data.

The combination of `Category` and `OriginalName` must be unique, as the `GetBlobInfoService` allows retrieval based on these values. Internally, a fresh and unique `Guid` is
generated and returned from this request. The response also contains the full `Url` by which this blob can be accessed (which will contain aforementioned `Guid`). Use this
path to POST your data, too!

- [x] The `MimeType` is required, a few suggestions would be `application/pdf`, `text/csv` or `application/json` - but you probably already know this.
- [x] The `ExpireDate` is the date at which the given blob should expire. Leave this empty to *suggest* to keep it forever. We will bag it and get rid of it when the time is right. :hocho:

When retrieving the blob, it will be returned to you using the `MimeType` as `ContentType` header and a proper `Expires` header.</p>
