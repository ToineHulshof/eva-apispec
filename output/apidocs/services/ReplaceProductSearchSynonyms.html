<h1>ReplaceProductSearchSynonyms</h1><p>Replaces all search synonyms for a given LanguageID/CountryID with the provided ones.
Any synonyms not present in the request but that currently exist will be deleted.

## Rules
The `Rule` must be formatted according to [what Elasticsearch accepts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html#_solr_synonyms):

- Comma-separated values: `jump, leap, hop` causes any of the matched terms to be replaced by all of the terms.
- Arrow notation: `britain=&gt;england` causes the left side to be replaced by the right side.

To create a synonym, a `LanguageID` is required.</p>
