<h1>AddDigitalGiftCardToOrder</h1><p>A specific implementation for `AddProductToOrder` for GiftCards. Adds a new order line for a digital GiftCard to specified order, where
`OrderID` identifies the order for the customer and `Amount` is the desired amount to create a GiftCard for.

Optionally supply a `DetailsUrl` pointing to the website you want the buyer of the GiftCard to land to see/manage the order.

Additionally, the `DisplayOptions` property need to be supplied, this contains a bunch of default options to personalize the giftcard.
It is also possible to provide some Metadata. We won&#39;t do any processing on DisplayOptions.

Except: DetailsUrl will be changed to include the `OrderID` in the URL as well as a `token` that can be used to access a few services.</p>
