<h1>ListCashTransactionLedger</h1><p>This service allows you to view the cash transaction ledger, which underlies all cash transactions,
such as received payments, moves between devices and expenses.

By default, you only get access to the cash transaction ledger for your current financial period. If
you have the `ManageCashTransactionLedger` permission, you&#39;re also allowed to filter on another financial
period.</p>
