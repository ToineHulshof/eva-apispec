<h1>GetEnumValues</h1><p>A generic service to return all possible values in specified list, e.g. `Currency`, `TaxCode` or `StockLabel`.

The `Name` of the enumeration is unique within EVA, and all of the `Values` returned are also unique and identifiable
by their respective `Name`. Services that consume a value of an enumeration will expect the numeric `Value` returned.

Some of these enumerations are static and are defined by code, meaning the `Values`&#39; combination of `Name` and `Value`
is contant and will never change. It is important to know, though, that other enumerations may be dynamic and can be
altered per environment by their own respective services. When using these, keep in mind they can vary between
environments and new values could be added. It is guaranteed, however, that once a certain `Name`-`Value` pair is set,
it will never change in that particular environment and you are safe treat it as a constant.

:point_right: It is important to realize these dynamics, because at first sight, all of these values may seem contant between
environments - but that is the mere result of an initialization sequence that is usually identical, but definitely
not guaranteed!

:point_right: `IsFlags` will indicate if the values should be treated as bit fields (or, a set of flags). For example,
the enumeration `OrganizationUnitTypes` demonstrates that an organization unit can both be a Shop (`1`) and a Warehouse (`16`)
at the same time, indicated by value `17`. Always use bitwise operands on these fields!</p>
