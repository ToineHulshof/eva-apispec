<h1>GetBundleProductDetails</h1><p>Gets the details of a bundle by its ProductID. The input to this service is `BundleProductID` which refers to the ID
of a `Product` that has `Type` = `BundleProduct`.

The details of a bundle is a structure containing the lines of the bundle, the available options for each line
of the bundle and, if it&#39;s a bundle of bundles or a bundle of configurable products, this structure is recursive; each option
can have lines of its own again. So the output of this service contains a tree of all the available products for the bundle.

The `IncludedFields` parameter is optional and allows you to specify which fields you wish to get back from this service.</p>
