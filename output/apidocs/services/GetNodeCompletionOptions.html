<h1>GetNodeCompletionOptions</h1><p>Retrieves the completion options for the provided node that is part of the provided AST.

If no AST is provided this service will return the completion options that a new sheet would have.

The completion options consist of three possible values:

- Alternatives: with which nodes can the requested node be replaced?
- NextStatements: if the node is a statement, which statements can come after it?
- SelfCompletion: if a node contains child nodes, what are the possible node types for those children?</p>
