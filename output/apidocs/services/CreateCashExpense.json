Either way, it should be a positive number.\n- A \u0060TaxCodeID\u0060, which refers to one of the available tax codes.\n- A \u0060Description\u0060, which is the reason for this expense (for example: \u0027lunch\u0027).\n- A \u0060BlobID\u0060, which contains an image of the receipt.\n- A \u0060SignatureBlobID\u0060, which contains an image of the signature",
