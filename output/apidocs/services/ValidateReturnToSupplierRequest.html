<h1>ValidateReturnToSupplierRequest</h1><p>Validate a ReturnToSupplierRequest

This will check if for all OrganizationUnits in the set a Supplier could be determined.

The service will return all available suppliers for each OrganizationUnit and will pick it when a single one is available.
When no Suppliers are available, no Order can be generated.
If more than one Supplier is available, the correct one should be picked with the SetSuppliersForReturnToSupplierRequest service.</p>
