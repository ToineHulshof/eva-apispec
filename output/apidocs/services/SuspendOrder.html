<h1>SuspendOrder</h1><p>When you would like to temporarily suspend an Order, you can use `SuspendOrder` to do so. To identify your suspended Order it is possible to supply a `Description`.
It is also possible to print a receipt of the suspended order to make it easier to continue later on. When printing a receipt, the `StationID` is mandatory.

To retreive the suspended orders, see the `ListSuspendedOrders` service.</p>
