  "description": "Updates some of the non-unique the OrganizationUnit\u0027s settings. This service can be used to only update a subset of the settings of the OrganizationUnit by providing only the fields you want to update.\nIf a field is not part of the request message (or has value \u0060undefined\u0060) then the setting is not updated. If the field is present but has a value of \u0060null\u0060 then it\u0027s assumed you want to unset the setting.\n\nThe targeted OrganizationUnits can be identified by providing \u0060OrganizationUnitIDs\u0060 or an \u0060OrganizationUnitSetID\u0060.\n\nAll OrganizationUnits will be updated, if one of them fails, no changes will be persisted."
