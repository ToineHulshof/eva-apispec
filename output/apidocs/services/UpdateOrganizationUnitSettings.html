<h1>UpdateOrganizationUnitSettings</h1><p>Updates the OrganizationUnit&#39;s settings. This service can be used to only update a subset of the settings of the OrganizationUnit by providing only the fields you want to update.
If a field is not part of the request message (or has value `undefined`) then the setting is not updated. If the field is present but has a value of `null` then it&#39;s assumed you want to unset the setting.</p>
