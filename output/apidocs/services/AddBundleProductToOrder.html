<h1>AddBundleProductToOrder</h1><p>The normal `AddProductToOrder` cannot be used for adding a Product with type `BundleProduct` to an order. Instead, `AddBundleProductToOrder` must be
used. In addition to the `BundleProductID`, this service accepts an optional `LineSelection`, which represents the bundle&#39;s configuration in terms of
which products you&#39;ve chosen.

The `LineSelection` data structure contains a `SelectedProductID`, which must refer to a ProductID that is a valid option for this bundle, according
to what `GetBundleProductDetails` returns.

If no `LineSelection` is provided then the default products of the bundle are added to the Order.</p>
