<h1>EditProduct</h1><p>Modifies given product by its `ID` for a specific `RevisionID`.

The `Edits` is a list of `ProductEdit` objects, that defines some `Content` and the `LanguageID`, `CountryID` and  `LayerID` it applies to. The `Content` is a Json object with key-value pairs that holds
product information. The keys are simple strings, but the value can be a scalar value (like an int or string), an array of scalar values or an array of objects.

A `Revision` is a versioning container in which one or more product modifications are buffered. The changes to the product do not apply directly, but instead are stored in this `Revision` until it is
ready to be published. Also see the `CreateRevision` and `ApplyRevision` services. When omitted, a new &#39;quick&#39; `Revision` is created and used here.

A `Layer` is a hierarchical solution to building product data. Every layer has its own `Level`, where the bottom layers will be overwritten by higher layers for colliding properties. A `Layer` has a
`Revision`. Also see the `CreateLayer` service. When omitted, a new &#39;quick&#39; `Layer` is created and used here.</p>
