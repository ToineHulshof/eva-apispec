<h1>CompleteCloseCashJournal</h1><p>Completes the closing of a cash journal, making the device once again unavailable for cash transactions until a new journal is opened.

This service expects a list of coins and notes, which summed up must equal the given `TotalAmount`.

If the `TotalAmount` is different from what was expected (returned as `ExpectedClosingAmount` in `StartCloseCashJournal` ) then this deviation
must be corrected and provided through a list of corrections in the `Corrections` field.

For cash journals that either do not use or ignore cash journals, most properties will automatically be set to the expected amounts. Should you
want to enforce validation, regardless, specify the `ForceValidation` as `true`.

Pending cash deposits need to be accounted for as well - supply their `ID`s as `PendingCashDeposits`. Do not add the `Amount` of cash deposits
to the `TotalAmount`, as the user cannot usually verify the cash deposit content.</p>
