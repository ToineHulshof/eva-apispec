  "description": "This service allows you to manually commit the stock for the given OrderLineIDs.\nThe response contains whether or not the commitment was successful, per OrderLine.\n\nCommitment can be unsucessful for two reasons:\n\n- No commitment is necessary. This is because it\u0027s an OrderLine that can\u0027t be committed, for example one without a stock product, or because the order type doesn\u0027t allow commitments.\n- Insufficient stock. This service only allows creating a commitment when there\u0027s sufficient available stock. Use the MoveCommitments or UncommitOrderLines services to create available stock."
