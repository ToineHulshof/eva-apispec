<h1>GetReturnableStatusForOrder</h1><p>Gets whether or not an Order is currently returnable.

For each OrderLine on the Order you&#39;ll get back a result that specifies whether or not it can be returned,
how much can be returned and which (if any) other OrderLines must be returned before the line itself can be returned
(think of parent-child lines where you can&#39;t return a child OrderLine without also returning the parent OrderLine).

In addition, this service may return `ReturnSets` which specify that &#39;if you return these OrderLines (specified by `OrderLineIDs`) then
you must *also* return these lines (specified by `RequiredOrderLineIDsToReturn`). For example, if you return all normal OrderLines on an Order
then you must also return all the free products you have received.</p>
