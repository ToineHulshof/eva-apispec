<h1>CreateStockAllocationRule</h1><p>Creates a StockAllocationRule for the SupplierOrganizationUnitID and OrganizationUnitID.

- If `ProductID` is left null, this is a &#39;catch-all&#39; rule, meaning that the rule applies to all products (but it can still be overriden by a rule with a specific `ProductID`).
Only a reservation can be a catch-all rule, a limitation must specify a `ProductID` or a `ProductSearchTemplateID`.
- `RefillPeriodInDays` is ignored when the Type is not a `Limitation`, as only a `Limitation` can be refilled.
- If `ValueType` is `Percentage`, then `Value` must be between 0 and 100.
- `OrganizationUnitSupplierID` is a reference to a supplier relationship between OrganizationUnits, not to an OrganizationUnit.
This is for example the supplier relationship between a warehouse and a store. Available OrganizationUnitSuppliers can be found through `ListOrganizationUnitSuppliers`.
- When left empty, OrganizationUnitID defaults to the OrganizationUnitID on the OrganizationUnitSupplier. So if the supplier relationship is between a warehouse and a store, this will
default to the store. When specified, the OrganizationUnitID *must* be one that the supplier of the relationship *directly* supplies to.
For example, if a supplier relationship exists between a warehouse and a country OrganizationUnit then you *can&#39;t* specify a store that falls
under that country OrganizationUnit. In that case, you should create a StockAllocationRule between the country and the store,
not between the warehouse and the store.</p>
