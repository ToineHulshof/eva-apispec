<h1>CreateAuditChainConfiguration</h1><p>Creates a new AuditChainConfiguration, which allows you to configure the starting number of a sequence and its prefix.
Creating a configuration for an audit chain that already exists does not apply this configuration. A new chain would need to be created by incrementing the Auditing:Version setting.</p>
