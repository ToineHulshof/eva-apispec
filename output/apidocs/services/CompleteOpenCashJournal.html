<h1>CompleteOpenCashJournal</h1><p>Completes the opening of a cash journal. After this service has been called, it&#39;s possible to make cash transactions on this device.

This service expects a list of the coins and notes that were counted.

When the opening amount is different from last period&#39;s closing amount, it&#39;s required that a correction is provided for this difference
in `OpeningDeviationCorrection`. This simply consists of a description and an amount.

For cash journals that either do not use or ignore cash journals, most properties will automatically be set to the expected amounts. Should you
want to enforce validation, regardless, specify the `ForceValidation` as `true`.

Pending cash deposits need to be accounted for as well - supply their `ID`s as `PendingCashDeposits`. Do not add the `Amount` of cash deposits
to the `TotalAmount`, as the user cannot usually verify the cash deposit content.</p>
