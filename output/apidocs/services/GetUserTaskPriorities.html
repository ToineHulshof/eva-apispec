<h1>GetUserTaskPriorities</h1><p>Return all of the configured User Task Priority configurations.

These are used at real-time on the User Task details whenever fetched, translating the User Task `Priority` into a `PriorityDescription`. The
`LanguageID` and `CountryID` filters are compared against the user context requesting this information, and the `UserTaskTypeID`, `UserTaskSubTypeID`
and `Priority` are taken from the User Task itself. The `Priority` from the User Task will be compared against the `From` and `To` ranges defined,
where the `From` priority is an *inclusive* lower bound, while `To` is the *exclusive* upper bound.

The `Description` will be used to describe the priority, but when left empty, will fall back to `Name`.

An example configuration could be as follows;

```
Language | From | To | Description
---------|------|----|------------
      NL |      |    | Standaard
      NL |   10 |    | Spoed
      DE |      | 10 | Unwichtig
         |      |    | Default
```

A User Task with priority 9 for a Dutch employee would be labelled &quot;Standaard&quot;, while for a German colleague this would be called &quot;Unwichtig&quot;. A
User Task of priority 10 would be called &quot;Spoed&quot; in Dutch, but &quot;Default&quot; in German.

:sunglasses: For added awesomeness, if you define overlapping priority ranges, we&#39;ll select the most narrow range for you.</p>
