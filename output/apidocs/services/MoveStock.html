<h1>MoveStock</h1><p>Books a set of Movements.

A Movement should either have a `ProductID` or `ProductBackendID` to identify the product, an `OrganizationUnitID` to identify the stock keeping
organization, a `SourceStockLabelID` and `DestinationStockLabelID` (see `GetEnumValues` with type `StockLabel`) and (of course) a `Quantity`
to actually book.

Supply a `BackendSystemID` on the request and `BackendID`&#39;s on the Movements to make the request idempotent.

Optionally supports a `StockMutationReasonID` and `Remark` for each Movement.</p>
