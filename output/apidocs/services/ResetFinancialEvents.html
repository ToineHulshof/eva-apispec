<h1>ResetFinancialEvents</h1><p>This service resets processed financial events back to unprocessed,
which means all associated financial ledgers are deleted.

Only financial events of periods that have not been fully processed (for example exported to an external ERP system)
can be reset.

As this can be a time consuming service, the request is handled in the background and upon completion a mail
is sent to the caller of this service with the results.

The scope of which events to reset can be limited by specifying a `Filter` in the request. Only the events
that match the filter will be reset.</p>
