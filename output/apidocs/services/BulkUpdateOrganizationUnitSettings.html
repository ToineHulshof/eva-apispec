<h1>BulkUpdateOrganizationUnitSettings</h1><p>Updates some of the non-unique the OrganizationUnit&#39;s settings. This service can be used to only update a subset of the settings of the OrganizationUnit by providing only the fields you want to update.
If a field is not part of the request message (or has value `undefined`) then the setting is not updated. If the field is present but has a value of `null` then it&#39;s assumed you want to unset the setting.

The targeted OrganizationUnits can be identified by providing `OrganizationUnitIDs` or an `OrganizationUnitSetID`.

All OrganizationUnits will be updated, if one of them fails, no changes will be persisted.</p>
