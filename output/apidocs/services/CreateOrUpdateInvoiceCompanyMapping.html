<h1>CreateOrUpdateInvoiceCompanyMapping</h1><p>Provides a mapping between an organization unit and a company based on a country. This mapping is used in scenarios for where delivery orders are
in play. E.g endless aisle (delivery order from a store) and an online order from a website for example.

To comply with regulations, these invoices that are generated require the tax registration number from the company that will be delivering the goods
with its specific registration from the country that the goods are send to.

If a mapping already exists for given `OrganizationUnitID` and `CountryID`, the `CompanyID` will be updated and `AlreadyExisted` in the response will be `true`.</p>
