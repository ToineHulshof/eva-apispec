<h1>ExemptOrderFromTax</h1><p>Marks the provided Order or OrderLine as exempt from tax, with specified code and reason.

When exempting the Order, this also marks all current OrderLines of the Order that haven&#39;t been invoiced yet as tax-exempt. All future
OrderLines created on this Order will then also automatically be made tax-exempt.

Calling this service is irreversible; once the Order is marked as tax exempt, it cannot be undone and can only be worked around by creating a new Order.</p>
