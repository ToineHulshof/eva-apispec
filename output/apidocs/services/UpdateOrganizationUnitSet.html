<h1>UpdateOrganizationUnitSet</h1><p>Updates an OrganizationUnitSet.

  Optionally a definition can be provided, which defines a set of filters.
  Any `OrganizationUnit` that matches the filters are automatically part of the set.

  To remove a definition from a set, pass it as `null` or as an empty object to this service. If you don&#39;t want to override
  it, pass the definition you got back from the `GetOrganizationUnitSet` service.</p>
