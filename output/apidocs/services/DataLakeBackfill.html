<h1>DataLakeBackfill</h1><p>Manually re-export specific DataLake documents.

These types are currently supported;

* `FinancialPeriods` = 1
* `Orders` = 2

Specify either a single `ID`, a list of `IDs`, or a datetime range `From` and `To` (inclusive).

As mandatory safety feature, specify the `MaxNumberOfDocuments` you&#39;d like to run this for. When the amount of documents through above
selection exceeds this number, this service will export NOTHING and return to you an error with the amount of documents it prevented you
from exporting, so you can adjust your selection or expand your max.

:warning: Triggering large amounts of data may impact system performance!

:point_right: The `ID` you are returned can be used in subsequent services `DataLakeBackfillStatus` and `DataLakeBackfillCancel`.</p>
