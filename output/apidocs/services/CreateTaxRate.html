<h1>CreateTaxRate</h1><p>Creates a tax rate.

* `CountryID` is a foreign key to the Countries table, which uses the ISO 3166-2 standard as ID
* `CountrySubdivisionID` is a foreign key to the CountrySubdivisions table, which uses the ISO 3166-2 standard as ID
* `TaxCodeID` is a foreign key to the TaxCodes table, which can be listed using the `ListTaxCodes` service

Percentages are a human readable formatted result of a fraction - applications use a `Rate` instead as an actual result of fraction to maintain
precision and integrity. If you wish to set a 21% tax percentage, that means a 1.21 tax rate. Setting a rate of 1.00 implies a 0% tax percentage,
and setting to 2.00 would mean a rediculous 100% tax percentage, doubling prices. You can probably tell that a `Rate` of 2.00 here is much more
readable than a 100% increase, but hey; nobody&#39;s forcing you to stick to percentages. At least - we&#39;re not!

Oh, and you can set a tax rate of 0.00, which would mean it will be fully sponsored by the government and will be free to purchase. The services
block anything lower than 0.00 and higher than 2.00 for sanity reasons. Will recap when governments gone mad.

:key: The combination of `CountryID`, `CountrySubdivision` and `TaxCodeID` is unique and will be enforced by EVA.

:point_right: `StartDate` and `EndDate` are optional, and can be used to transition from one rate to a next when it changes. Both these dates
are inclusive, meaning you&#39;d want to set the `EndDate` of the expiring tax rate to 2018-12-31 and the `StartDate` of the new tax rate to
2019-01-01 (for example).</p>
