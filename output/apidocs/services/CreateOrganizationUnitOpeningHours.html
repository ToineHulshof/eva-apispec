<h1>CreateOrganizationUnitOpeningHours</h1><p>Create new OpeningHours for OrganizationUnits

Multiple items can be created in a single request. Also multiple OrganizationUnits are allowed.

It&#39;s not allowed to create multiple items for a single day on the same store. This is checked for Day based openinghours and Date based openinghours.

Openinghours wit a Date component override the openinghours on Day level. They are called SpecialOpeningHours most of the time.

To close a store on a regular day, just don&#39;t create an openinghour for that day (or delete it).
To close a store on a specific date, create an openinghour with StartTime=null, EndTime=null</p>
