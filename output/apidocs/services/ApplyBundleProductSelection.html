<h1>ApplyBundleProductSelection</h1><p>This service is used to apply a selection of products to the provided `BundleProductOrderLineID`.
The `BundleProductOrderLineID` field refers to the ID of an `OrderLine` on the provided `Order` that has a `BundleProduct` Product on it.
The `LineSelection` field is a list that couples a `SelectedProductID` to a `ProductBundleLineID` and is identical to how it&#39;s used in `AddBundleProductToOrder`.</p>
