<h1>CreateReplenishmentProposal</h1><p>Creates a new `ReplenishmentProposal`.

The new proposal is picked up and processed asynchronously and could take a while after creation to complete generating its results, depending on the
amount of sources, targets, products and the algorithm used. Check the `Status` property in the `GetReplenishmentProposal` response to see if it&#39;s
completed.

To allow selecting the output types for the generated proposal, the property `OutputTypes` can be set. It is a flags enum of the type
`ReplenishmentOutputTypes`. If the `OutputTypes` is not set, it will fall back to the setting `Replenishment:Outputs`.</p>
