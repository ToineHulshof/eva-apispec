<h1>DropOffCashDeposit</h1><p>Drops-off a cash deposit previously created and stored on a device (`CreateCashDeposit.DelayDropOff`).

Cash deposits created this way will remain in status Pending (`-1`) until it is either dropped-off (`DropOffCashDeposit`) or deleted (`DeleteCashDeposit`). Whilst
pending, it will not create any events, will not be attached to any `CashTransactionLedger` and therefor will not be attached to any `FinancialPeriod`. You can find
these pending cash deposits using `ListCashDeposits`, but then only when filtering for a `DeviceID` and/or `OrganizationUnitID` (and optionally `StatusID`).</p>
