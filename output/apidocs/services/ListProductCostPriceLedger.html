<h1>ListProductCostPriceLedger</h1><p>This service lets you view the ProductCostPriceLedger, optionally filtered by ProductID/OrganizationUnitID and others.

The ProductCostPriceLedger is used to determine the cost prices of stock for OrganizationUnits that use CostPriceCalculationMethod = Fifo.

For those OrganizationUnits, whenever stock is received in them, a record is stored in the ProductCostPriceLedger noting the quantity and the purchase price of that stock and then whenever
stock is reduced this ledger is consulted in a first-in-first-out manner to determine the cost price of that stock mutation. This service gives you insight into that ledger.</p>
