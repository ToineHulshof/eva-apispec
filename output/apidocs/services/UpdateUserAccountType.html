<h1>UpdateUserAccountType</h1><p>This service is used to change the AccountType of a Customer.

When changing the AccountType from Standard to Incognito or Basic, all credentials and roles are removed.

When changing the AccountType from Incognito or Basic to Standard:
- Uniqueness checks are done for the EmailAddress and Nickname
- Default customer roles are generated
- When no password is provided, one is generated and returned in the response
- If configured, the user will receive an `welcome to EVA` email. If no valid password is provided, the email will also contain a generated password.</p>
