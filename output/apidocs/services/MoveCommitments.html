<h1>MoveCommitments</h1><p>This service allows you to move stock commitments from one OrderLine (`SourceOrderLineID`) to another OrderLine (`DestinationOrderLineID`).

- If the Source and Destination do not share the same ProductID, a `CannotMoveCommitment` error is returned.
- If the Source does not have a commitment, a `CannotMoveCommitment` error is returned.</p>
