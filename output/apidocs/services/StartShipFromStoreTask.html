<h1>StartShipFromStoreTask</h1><p>Starts a ShipFromStore task, identified by its UserTaskID.

The service returns the order that should be shipped from the user&#39;s current store as well as the OrderLines
that should be part of the shipment. Not necessarily all orderlines of the order should be shipped, so the
OrderLineIDs returned by this service should be respected.</p>
