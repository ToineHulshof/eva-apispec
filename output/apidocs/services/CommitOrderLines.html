<h1>CommitOrderLines</h1><p>This service allows you to manually commit the stock for the given OrderLineIDs.
The response contains whether or not the commitment was successful, per OrderLine.

Commitment can be unsucessful for two reasons:

- No commitment is necessary. This is because it&#39;s an OrderLine that can&#39;t be committed, for example one without a stock product, or because the order type doesn&#39;t allow commitments.
- Insufficient stock. This service only allows creating a commitment when there&#39;s sufficient available stock. Use the MoveCommitments or UncommitOrderLines services to create available stock.</p>
