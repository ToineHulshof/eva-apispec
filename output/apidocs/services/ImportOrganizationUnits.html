<h1>ImportOrganizationUnits</h1><p>Creates or updates specified `OrganizationUnits`, identified by your `ID` (that we map to our `BackendID`).

Omit any field you don&#39;t want altered, or send in null values of nullable fields to unset their current value.

- Does not apply to `Address` - if you specify a new or different one from the current, a new Address will be created with only the data specify!
- Does not apply to `OpeningHours` - every value you specify will either update or create a record for that day</p>
