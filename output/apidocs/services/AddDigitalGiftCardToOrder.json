  "description": "A specific implementation for \u0060AddProductToOrder\u0060 for GiftCards. Adds a new order line for a digital GiftCard to specified order, where\n\u0060OrderID\u0060 identifies the order for the customer and \u0060Amount\u0060 is the desired amount to create a GiftCard for.\n\nOptionally supply a \u0060DetailsUrl\u0060 pointing to the website you want the buyer of the GiftCard to land to see/manage the order.\n\nAdditionally, the \u0060DisplayOptions\u0060 property need to be supplied, this contains a bunch of default options to personalize the giftcard.\nIt is also possible to provide some Metadata. We won\u0027t do any processing on DisplayOptions.\n\nExcept: DetailsUrl will be changed to include the \u0060OrderID\u0060 in the URL as well as a \u0060token\u0060 that can be used to access a few services.",
